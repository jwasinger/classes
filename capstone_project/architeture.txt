Intro:
The structure of the RNC CDN can be visualized using a directed graph where
 nodes represent individual servers, each holding a portion of the CDN's data.  
 Edges represent a "logical network connection"(definition) between servers through which data can be sent and received. 

User Interaction:
  Using a normal CDN, data is retrieved via HTTP GET from the user's host to whichever
  CDN server is the closest.
  Random Encoding adds a layer of complexity to this model by requiring data to be decoded before it can be read and used.  In addition,
  due to the random partitioning of data across multiple CDN servers,
  retrieving one file from the RNC CDN requires data transfer from several servers 
  and subsequent reassembling of received data. In practice, this means that the process of retrieving data from the user's point of view look like the following:

  1) User makes HTTP GET request to the "Master Server" for a given resource.
  2) Master server responds with a "File Header" containing information about where different shards of the data are located (IP/Port).
  3) User establishes simultaneous HTTP/HTTPS connections with all the endpoints and downloads each data shard.
  4) User decodes and reassembles data.
